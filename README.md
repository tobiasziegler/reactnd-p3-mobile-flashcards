# Mobile Flashcards

A React Native mobile application for Android and iOS that allows you to study
collections of flashcards. The app will allow you to create different categories
of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes
on those decks.

I've built this app as part of
[Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## Running the App

This project was developed with
[Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

To run, test and develop Mobile Flashcards on your computer and mobile device:

1. Fork, clone or download this repository.

1. From the project directory, run `yarn install` to setup the project's
   dependencies.

1. Install the [Expo](https://expo.io/) app on your iOS or Android phone.

1. Run `yarn start` to package the app.

1. From the Expo app, scan the QR code that appears in the terminal.

1. The app includes a small set of sample data. You can reset the content in the
   app to this data set using the button on the My Decks screen.

See the documentation for
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/),
[Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app),
and [Expo](https://expo.io/) for more advanced guidance on development and
testing options.

## Supported Devices

The app has been tested on iOS (iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 11.2, and iOS
Simulator emulating an iPhone X) and Android (Android Studio's emulator
configured for a Pixel 2).

## About the App
